# Objects as Toys / Toys as Functions

The proposed workshop aims to explore the functionalist perspective that propose 
that things are what things do. In that sense, objects — in the broadest sense of the term —,
much like toys and their embedded possibility of infinite play,  are abstract realisable
identities constructing and being constructing through contextual performativity.

The practical investigation of such claim will be done through the discussion of a selection 
of texts and through the implementation of simple computational exercises that will bring 
forward the complicities between artworks, toys, models and functions.
