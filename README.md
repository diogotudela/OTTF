The OTTF workshop aims to explore the functionalist perspective that propose that things are what things do. In that sense, objects — in the broadest sense of the term —, much like toys and their embedded possibility of infinite play,  are abstract realisable identities constructing and being constructed through contextual performativity. The practical investigation of such claim will be done through the discussion of a selection of texts and through the implementation of simple computational exercises that will bring forward the complicities between artworks, toys, models and functions.
